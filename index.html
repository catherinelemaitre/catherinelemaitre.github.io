				Hello, my name is Catherine Lemaitre and I am a registered BACP Psychotherapist and Counsellor <br><br>
		
				I see each person’s own experience as unique and strive to help clients unlock the skills and resources they have within themselves to face the inevitable difficulties of life.  As an existential psychotherapist I have a deep interest in how we create meaning in our lives and understand that this is often unclear.  I approach my clients with care, openness and empathy in order to support their specific needs and to help explore these in an increasingly unsettling world.  When appropriate, I integrate other approaches in the therapeutic process, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic and integrative somatic trauma therapy. <br><br>

				I have worked with clients experiencing many different issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, low self-esteem, chronic pain, illness, relationship issues or a general sense of being stuck in life. <br><br>

				I can work using the following languages with adults and adolescents during our sessions together: English, French and Hebrew <br><br>

				<div class="font-bold"> Training and Previous Experience </div>

				I gained a PGDip in Existential Psychotherapy and Counselling, (NSPC) <br><br>

				I am currently completing my doctoral degree (DProf) in existential psychotherapy at the New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling (NSPC), affiliated to Middlesex University.  My doctoral research is on the experience of relational depth in group therapy. <br><br>
				
				I also have a Masters in Economics and previously my career was in industry. I worked for ten years as the CEO of an asset management company.  This taught me how to coach teams and support employees at different stages of their careers and these skills can be brought to you if you are struggling with work-related issues. <br><br>

				<div class="font-bold"> Fees and Availability </div>

				I am currently seeing clients face to face at <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://www.hqtherapy.com"> HQ Therapy </a>  in East London, Kentish Town in North London, and online (Zoom, Skype etc.). I offer a short initial free phone consultation to discuss your needs and answer any questions you might have. Subsequently, my fee is £70 for a 50 minute session. <br><br>
